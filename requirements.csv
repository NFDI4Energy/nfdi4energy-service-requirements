REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-LINKED-METADATA,📜Links between metadata records,Design,Metadata Schema,Low,"Help users to traverse semantically linked metadata records that are similiar, different, related, etc. This can involve data from the same or different project, a similar purpose or an explicitly specified difference. This can be achieved using an explicit field for links in the metadata schema",2024-08-15,,Provide a generic metadata module in the schema that focuses on relations to other datasets and think about a good collection of relations between them.
REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-REUSE-AGREED-SEMANTICS,📜The metadata schema reuses agreed upon terms and semantics,Design,Metadata Schema,High,It is vital to not create duplicate definitions to improve interoperability. This should be done using pre-existing ontologies wherever possible,2024-09-17,,Importing / Referencing of all ontologies that provide useful terms or semantics
REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-CONTROLLED-VOCABULARIES,📜Fields in the schema shall use controlled vocabularies as much as possible,Design,Metadata Schema,High,"Prevent the interoperability issues that arise with custom human input, by using controlled vocabularies for user input where possible",2024-08-15,,"Use either ENUM like instances of a type in OWL or specify a base class for terms as child classes, use public identifiers of a certain pattern (e.g. purl, doi, orcid, etc.) - multiple solutions will be necessary. Consider using Terminology services or special term lookup services like the DBpedia Lookup"
REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-FIELD-IMPORTANCE,📜Fields need to be categorized by importance,Design,Metadata Schema,Medium,"To allow users to quickly grasp which metadata fields are more important we need to cluster them into mandatory, optional, etc. ",2024-10-22,,Additional attribute for all metadata fields (compare OEM Badges)
REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-MODULARITY,📜Modularity,Design,Metadata Schema,High,To ensure a good quality of metadata for a given entity it is important to have specifically tailored sets of metadata fields. It makes sense to group several fields together if they always appear in a common context. Each of these modules needs to have a precise and limited scope. Smaller is often better in this context.,2024-10-22,,Cluster metadata fields in modules and allow one entity to be annotated by a set of these modules. A strategy to find the correct modules needs to be worked out
REQ-DESIGN-SCHEMA-LANGUAGE,📜Language,Design,Metadata Schema,High,"Since key value maps only see a key equal if it matches 100% it is necessary to have all keys in a common language. We propose to use only English names for the keys. If a serialization format allows multiple languages also other languages can be supported, but English must have the highest priority",2024-10-22,,Just use English keys for the fields and perform translations only with annotation properties
REQ-DESIGN-TOOLING-STATE-OF-THE-ART,🔧 Metadata Schema Implementation Tools,Design,Tooling,High,The Metadata schema shall be created and maintained using state-of-the-art tools of the semantic web domain,2024-09-23,,The core metadata schema shall be edited in Protege.

REQ-DESIGN-TOOLING-IMPROVEMENT,🔧 Metadata Schema Improvement Tools,Design,Tooling,Medium,"To enhance the interoperability of the metadata schema with other metadata schemas and improve the overall quality of metadata, it is important to try to reuse existing terms. Finding these can be aided with the use of terminology search and cross-walks between metadata standards. The used design tools shall assist the developer in applying these mechanisms.",2024-09-23,,Protege can be used to edit the metadata schema. Protege could have useful plugins for terminology search from important other metadata standards. Otherwise a plugin might be configurable against a DBPedia Lookup that was initialized with common metadata standards.
REQ-IMPL-SCHEMA-PROVIDED-FILES,📜Provided schema files,Implementation,Metadata Schema,High,A formalized specification of the schema is necessary. The preferred format is in a semantic format like Turtle/Notation3. Additionally the schema files shall be provided as JSON schema (both plain JSON and JSON-ld) as a convenience for external use cases. Only the semantic format can be considered the root schema and the others most be updated on every change respectively. These types of formats are prioritized because of their validation and form generation capabilities,2024-09-23,,JSON-Schema files can be generated from an OWL/SHACL specification of the root schema
REQ-IMPL-RECORD-STORAGE-FEDERATION,📝Metadata serialization formats shall be storable in a way that supports SPARQL federation,Implementation,Metadata Record,high,"Metadata shall be easily queriable among federated SPARQL endpoints, to improve findability.

Alternatively metadata can be stored in a way that allows for virtual SPARQL endpoints to achieve the same effect.
REQ-IMPL-RECORD-FORMAT-STANDARDS,📝Metadata serialization formats need to be standardized,Implementation,Metadata Record,high,"Make sure that metadata is stored with a standardized serialization format, so most tools and frameworks natively support parsing and serializing it",2024-08-15,"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C171252, http://edamontology.org/format_1915, https://schema.org/encodingFormat","This means the preferred serialization formats are RDF/XML, JSON-LD, Turtle, N3 and Ntriples. Nevertheless, other standardized formats as XML, JSON, YAML and TOML are also valid and can be used."
REQ-METADATA-SUBMODULE-STORAGE-STRUCTURE,📝 Metadata record submodules storage structure,Implementation,Metadata Record,high,Submodules will need to reference each other and a flat way of storage is superior if multiple submodules might reference the same submodule,2024-10-22,https://schema.org/DefinedTermSet (A submodule is a Defined Term Set that contains metadata fields relevant to the topic of the submodule.) https://schema.org/inDefinedTermSet (could use this to note if a term belongs to more than one submodule) https://schema.org/citation (could use this property of a Defined Term Set to track other sets that it references),Use JSON $ref in JSON and the respective URIs in RDF based file formats
REQ-IMPL-TOOLING-RECORD-CREATION-SERVICE,🔧 Metadata record Implementation Tools,Implementation,Tooling,Medium,To ensure that the creation of metadata records can be done easily from different application contexts a service solution for the creation can be beneficial.

REQ-INTEGRATION-SCHEMA-STANDARD-INTEROPERABILITY,📜Allow interoperability between existing metadata standards,Integration,Metadata Schema,Medium,"Metadata records for our schema should be easily interoperable with other platforms that use different schemas, as it prevents re-annotation of metadata in other formats and supports data access to and from other platforms",2024-08-15,,Schema crosswalks to the most relevant standards are helpful for federated searches and form a foundation of format conversions. Scripts shall be provided to convert from and to our schema for a selected set of standards. Evaluate formalized (semantic) formats for crosswalks and recommend one that can be integrated into existing knowledge graphs / ontologies.
REQ-INTEGRATION-SCHEMA-APPLICATION-GUIDELINES,📜Requirements for applications using the metadata schema,Integration,Metadata Schema,Low,Allow developers to get going with the schema quickly with a clear set of requirements on how to integrate and work with the metadata schema and records.

REQ-INTEGRATION-TOOLING-METADATA-FLEXIBILITY-FOR-APPLICATIONS,🔧 Metadata Integration Tools,Integration,Tooling,Medium,"A unified metadata schema used by the tools shall provide capabilities that allows each tool to customize the schema in certain limits to be best suited for the given use case of the tool. For example tools should be able to define explicit rules for what metadata fields are necessary and which are optional. Also the use of certain domain-specific metadata schemas/modules should be controllable, ensuring that relevant metadata is captured.",2024-09-23,,The input forms for metadata should be somehow generated. This might require inputs from the developer on what metadata modules are relevant and if certain fields should have a non-standard mandatory state. This could work best with a service that produces metadata forms that can be configured via the parameters to the endpoint
REQ-INTEGRATION-TOOLING-STANDARD-EXPORTS,🔧 Provide export capabilities,Integration,Tooling,Medium,To boost compatibility and interoperability it is necessary to provide exports in a selection of well established metadata standards,2024-10-22,,"Use formalized crosswalks to perform a conversion to classic standards like DCT, Datacite, ..."

REQ-USE-SCHEMA-DOCUMENTATION-STAKEHOLDER-USERS,📜Schema documentation shall be understandable for users that need to fill or read metadata,Use,Metadata Schema,Medium,"The schema documentation must provide helpful information to users without semantics or metadata background, so it should not just be focused around developers",2024-08-15,,"This is hard to measure, so for now just involve end users in the design of the documentation."
REQ-USE-SCHEMA-CURATED-CONTROLLED-VOCABS,📜Allow for a curated way to extend controlled vocabularies,Use,Metadata Schema,Medium,"Strict controlled vocabularies can cause frustration for users, if they are unable to correctly express the meta information that would be best suited. Free text can sometimes describe better what a certain artifact / dataset is about, if there are no matching values in the controlled vocabulary. However, free text causes interoperability issues, so it is necessary to provide a process that allows to add new items to a controlled vocabulary in a curated way, that does not hinder the workflow of the user",2024-08-15,,"Embedding a terminology search into a metadata input form when there can be no proper choice made to find a reference in an ontology for a term. If the term from the other ontology fulfills yet to be determined characteristics it might be possible to extend the vocabulary with that term (initially for the time the form is active) and on a long run the added ""external"" terms could be curated and either accepted or revoked centrally for the schema."
REQ-USE-RECORD-SIMPLE-UI,📝Metadata UI needs to be simple and streamlined,Use,Metadata Record,High,Don't annoy or scare users with complex forms or workflows as this will prevent them from entering data alltogether.

REQ-USE-RECORD-SIMPLIFY-LINKING,📝Simplify linking between metadata records,Use,Metadata Record,Low,For easier navigation and understanding relations between multiple (data) artifacts - it is necessary to allow to link between metadata records easily. Users are not likely to manually look up relations themselves. As a result any user interface should assist the user in finding appropriate potentially related metadata records automatically.,2024-08-15,,"Search for strategies how to identify metadata records with a certain degree of similarties, such that a service can propose them to be added as a related metadata record. (Use the OEP scenario comparision as a foundation)"
REQ-USE-RECORD-LANGUAGES,📝Metadata record value languages,Use,Metadata Record,Low,Ontologies do support annotation in multiple languages so any user interface shall be allowed to present metadata in any given language as long as the formal serialization is again in the standard language. Controlled vocabularies might also provide translations for a given item.,2024-11-07,,User interface code can use the respective language annotations for labels when displaying both fieldnames and selected (controlled) values

This enables consistency, traceability, and compatibility across systems. The versioning system should include identifiers for major, minor, and patch updates. Each version should also link to release notes and modification dates where applicable. The current and all older versions must be accessible via a GUPRI.",2024-08-15,"https://schema.org/version, https://schema.org/releaseNotes, https://schema.org/dateModified","Use semantic versioning (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and reference the used version in the metadata schema, so each record can be clearly referenced to the used version."
REQ-REVIEW-RECORD-FORMAT-VALIDATION,📝Metadata serialization format validation,Review,Metadata Record,High,Validation of metadata records improves the quality of metadata. Therefore used record serializations must allow for standardized validation mechanisms. Validation needs to be done in two stages (client and server) to first improve UX and second guarantee record conformance,2024-08-15,,JSON schema and JSONld can be used in conjunction to validate input metadata records. If using other semantic formats the superior validation of SHACL can be applied. Web user interfaces often support client side validation this should be applied whenever possible.
